# Skill8Up Week 5 Weather Dashboard App

## Weather Dashboard

## üéØ Overview

This project is a Weather Dashboard application that allows users to retrieve current weather information for a
specified location. The application leverages
the [openweathermap.org](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://openweathermap.openweathermap.org/) API to convert a
user-entered location into geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) and then fetches the current weather details
for those coordinates.

The primary goal of this challenge is to demonstrate proficiency in working with third-party APIs, parsing JSON
responses, selecting specific data, and dynamically updating a user interface using JavaScript.

*NB: requirements folder contains detailed readme and rubrics.*

## ‚ú® Features

* **Location-Based Weather**: Get current weather data by entering a city name or postal code.
* **Geocoding Integration**: Converts location names to latitude and longitude using OpenWeatherMap's Geocoding API.
* **Current Weather Display**: Shows the location name, temperature, and a brief weather description.
* **Dynamic UI Updates**: The dashboard updates in real-time as new weather data is fetched.
* **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles invalid locations or failed API requests with informative messages.

## üìú User Story

As a user, I want to enter a location into the Weather Dashboard, and I want the application to display the current
weather for that location, including the name, temperature, and a short description of the weather conditions.

## üìã Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The user can enter a location (city name or postal code) into the input field, and the app will fetch the weather
  data for that location.
- [ ] The app converts the entered location into latitude and longitude using the OpenWeatherMap Geocoding API.
  - Endpoint: `https://api.openweathermap.org/geo/1.0/direct?q=<location>&appid=<API_KEY>`
- [ ] After getting the latitude and longitude, the app uses this data to fetch the current weather details using the
  OpenWeatherMap Weather API.
  - Endpoint: `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?lat=<lat>&lon=<lon>&appid=<API_KEY>`
- [ ] Only the following data is displayed on the dashboard:
  - **Location name** (e.g., city name)
  - **Temperature** in Celsius or Fahrenheit
  - **Weather description** (e.g., "clear sky", "light rain")
- [ ] The UI is updated dynamically when the data is fetched successfully, displaying the current weather on the
  dashboard.
- [ ] The app handles errors gracefully, including invalid locations or failed API requests, and displays appropriate
  error messages.

## üß† Key Learnings

This challenge provides an opportunity to learn and practice:

* Working and collaborating as a development team
* Planning and coordinating tasks and resources
* Collaborating using GitHub, branches, and Pull Requests
* How to work with a 3rd Party API that requires basic authentication.
* Parsing and selecting specific data from a JSON response.
* Updating the UI dynamically using JavaScript.
